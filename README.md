### Smart Contract Audit System

The Smart Contract Audit System aims to assist users in identifying potential vulnerabilities in smart contract code. The platform should provide a responsive website that allows users to upload their smart contract code. By utilizing existing smart contract static analysis tools, the platform can rapidly analyze the contract code and identify potential issues. Users can view the detection results on the website, enabling them to promptly identify and address any vulnerabilities in their contracts.

### Core Functional Requirements:

1. Users can submit their smart contracts for auditing, and the system should accept smart contract files in common formats like Solidity (.sol).
2. The system will employ static analysis techniques to assess smart contracts for potential vulnerabilities and security risks.
3. The system should display comprehensive audit reports on a dedicated page, emphasizing the identified vulnerabilities and their respective categories.
4. The system needs to provide corresponding suggestions for each vulnerability category.
5. Users should be able to retrieve previous reports
